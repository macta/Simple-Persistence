I am used by SpFileDatabase to do the actual serialization and materialization. Currently, Fuel is the only supported serializer. The original ReferenceStream serializer has been packaged as SimplePersistence-ReferenceStream just in case a legacy system requires it, but there is no hook to install it, so you'd have to override SpFileDatabase>>serializer.
